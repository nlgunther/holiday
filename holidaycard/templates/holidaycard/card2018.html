<h1> AT THE BEGINNING OF 2019 </h1>

<div id=holidaytext> We'd like to thank you all for being our friends over the years, for sharing with us what there was to share.  
It was Moltke who said no plan survives first contact with enemy.  This year, a more trenchant observation was that no plan we made survived first contact with our twin two-year olds.  In broad paraphrase:<hr>
Twins to right of us<br>
Twins to left of us<br>
Twins in front of us,<br>
Giggled and bumbled.<hr>
Or something like that.  Johnny, our third boy and well into his fifth year, ever his own man, took it upon himself to assume the role of ringleader and kingpin, urging his younger siblings to ever more radical experiments, our increasingly desparate attempts to dissuade him notwithstanding.  <br>
Later in the year, he developed, spontaneously, an interest verging on youthful obsession with Lego creations, emerging after hours alone in his room with creations, both complex and visually arresting, that he referred to, unfortunately and more than a little unsettlingly, as 'warships.'  <br>
What is a parent to do?<br>
In answer to that vexing question, one of us proposed a crash course in Latin leading to the special pleasure of reading Ceasar's accounts of his engagingly (to a five-year old boy, or at least so one hopes) violent Gallic wars. The youth in question received the proposal warmly, but has yet to act on it. <br>
It's always nice to have something to look forwad to.
